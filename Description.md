# Captain-Ecks

Captain Ecks is a pirate themed action adventure game with some RPG element and was created using Unreal Engine 4 as the final year project of my degree.

The player will take control of the captain as they attempt to return to their ship by fighting through a number of enemies. The player will need to manage abilities and loot as they upgrade their character in order to face bigger challenges and out score their friends. Created using unreal engine, Captain Ecks uses blueprints to adapt to the player’s choice of difficulty level, determining spawn rates and health percentages that will in turn have a great impact on how you will approach the game. This project includes key elements such as;
<ul><li>	Artificial intelligence in the form of two different types of enemies that will actively pursue and attack the player.</li>
<li>	Character abilities. As the game progresses players will be able to purchase abilities to use during gameplay, once an ability has been activated a short “cooldown” time will need to take place before that ability can be performed again.</li>
<li>	There is a Loot system within Captain Ecks, during gameplay the player can collect coins which are then converted into “Loot”, this loot can be spent in the shop on upgrades such as better weapons, more health, new abilities, etc. </li></ul>
Captain Ecks provides a fun and challenging pirate adventure, with abilities and a loot system adding to the strategy involved with playing the game.
